Docs and code to learn and explore Claude MCP.

## Introduction

This is a live working set of documents and code to learn and explore Claude MCP. The code is written in Python and uses the Claude MCP library.

I did this work while also learning Zed as my new IDE. Zed is also configured with Claude Sonnet as the AI assistant (inline and chat).

## Using Zed and Claude AI Assistant

Ok, so this is not specific to Claude MCP -- though there is an MCP Protocol piece -- but I'm learning Zed at the same time (two birds with one stone, ay? ðŸ˜œ ).

Call me old fashioned but I read the [Zed Assistant Documentation](https://zed.dev/docs/assistant/assistant) first. It's like a pre-warm routine for my brain... Here's the main things I'm doing with Zed and AI:

1. [Assistant (chat) panel](#assistant-chat-panel).
2. [Inline assistant](#inline-assistant).
3. [Configure the AI assistant](#configure-the-ai-assistant).
4. [Using previous contexts](#using-previous-contexts).
5. [Using slash commands](#using-slash-commands).
6. [Using the prompt library](#using-the-prompt-library).
7. [MCP Context Servers](#msp-context-servers).
